# Share To Workplace

Share to Workplace is a chrome extension which makes it easy for you to share things from the 
web to your workplace account. This extension will take you to the Workplace organization you were most
recently active in within this session.

## Creating dedicated extension for your organization's use
You want an extension and don't want this figuring out to happen, as it requires you to first load
some other subdomain. You can get one especially catered for your needs with your logo and takes you directly
to your workplace, giving a sense of ownness and full Company experience. You can get in touch with me at

### Future todos
Some of the things, we are definitely planning on to build in the future include:
- Options Page
- Minimal Analytics (so we can see what is working for users and what's not )
- Improve the modularization within the code, so it's easier for us to remake the extensions
- Add a better build system, so we can build the code easily

#### Why using analytics?

We don't copy any data that can identify the content the user is sharing, the user itself, or the organization. However,
Workplace doesn't allow us to issue an `appId` like what Facebook does. This can help us in gathering analytics, but
this feature isn't available unfortunately. When we add analytics, we are going to be totally fair with what we do!
